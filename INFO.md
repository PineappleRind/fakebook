Blind Coding Project

## What's this?**

It's my attempt at coding without seeing the output of my code until the project is finished.

## Why? I get that it's fun and it's a challenge, but is there any  real reason?**

No! Purely fun. I've always wanted to try it but never had the experience.

## What are you making?**

I'll be making a social media app. Like Twitter. But homemade.
